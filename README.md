A minimalist project for consuming/testing light client related messages being broadcasted via gossip on the p2p network

#### TODO
- Make the Typescript integration works. Currently fails with what looks like version incompatibility 
- Consume other gossip topics
- Add support for Res/Req
- Use the messages to follow the chain
